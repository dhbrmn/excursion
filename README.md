### My take on the "Excursion Project" by Codecademy

While I was learning about Git and GitHub on Codecademy I was tasked to recreate a basic html page using html and css coding based of a picture and some parameters like fonts and colors etc.

The real task here was to get more comfortable with the Git workflow and try different things I haven't done so far such as submiting pull requests *(although I reviewed and approved them in the end)*, creating different branches etc.

>That being said I think I didn't do **too bad** at recreating the html even though I'm not really focusing on that yet.

Anyway, to whom it may concern, you can prewiev the html [here](https://dhbrmn.github.io/excursion).

That's all there is to it. Cheers!
