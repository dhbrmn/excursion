#My take on the "Excursion Project"

While I was learning about Git and GitHub on Codecademy I was tasked to mimic a basic html page using html and css coding.

The real task here was to get more comfortable with the Git workflow and to try different things I havent done so far such as submiting pull requests (although it was myself who approved them in the end xD), creating different branches etc.

>That being said I think I didn't do *too bad* at mimicking the html even though I'm not really focusing on that yet.

That's all there is to it. Cheers!
